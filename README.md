### Grove City College Campus Map ###

#### Andrew Eissen ####

##### About this Project #####
This project was created to map and list the various structures found on the college campus of the Western Pennsylvania school Grove City College, seeing as a detailed, interactive map does not exist.

A slightly modified functional example may be found at <a href="aeissen-neighborhood-map.appspot.com">aeissen-neighborhood-map.appspot.com</a>.

##### Functionality #####
This project provides a collapsable search and results popup window, allowing for the instant search and selection of a desired building. Map results are filtered by Knockout JS in real time.

This project utilizes the third party data API Weather Underground (Stratus Developer Packet) mixed with AJAX to provide updated weather reports on every click of the associated button. As every Grover knows, weather and temperature at the College often change at the most irrational and inconvenient moments, and this function helps track such changes.

##### Opening and Running the Project #####
In order to run the project, simply download the entire project and double-click on the file marked "index.html" in the main directory. The page will open in a browser tab.
